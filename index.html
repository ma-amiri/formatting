          &#128073; In HTML,for example the&lt;h1&gt;element is a
          semantic element,which gives the text it wraps around the role(or
          meaning)of "a top level heading on your page."
        </li>
        <li>&#x25B8;<mark>Here is a top level heading</mark></li>
        <li>
          &#128073; By default, most browser's user agent stylesheet will style
          an&lt;h1&gt;with a large font size to make it look like
          a heading(although you could style it to look like anything you
          wanted).On the other hand, you could make any element look like a top
          level heading.
        </li>
        <li>&#x25B8;<mark>Consider th following</mark></li>
        <li>
          &#x21DB;This will render it to look like a top level heading. but it
          has no semantic value, so it will not extra benefit as described
          above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for
          the right job.
        </li>
        <li>
          &#x21DB;HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be
          populated and not based on its default presentation
          styling.Presentation(how it should look), is the sole responsibility
          of CSS
